                <p style="color:black;font-family:Aclonica-Regular;">Hello people of the internet, if you are viewing this that means you are curious about how HTML and CSS work,
                    good for you. Firstly in case you have no clue what Html(Hypertext Markup Language) or CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
                    are they are simple just the languages/components used for creating websites and codes. HTML focuses mainly on the 
                    actual build and layout of the code meaning where everything will go, CSS however aims more for the aestetics of 
                    the code so making everything look nice and how you want it to.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#" style="color:black;font-family:Aclonica-Regular;">How html can access CSS</a></h3>
                        <p style="color:black;font-family:Aclonica-Regular;">There are three main possible ways for HTML to access CSS: Inline, Internal and External.
                            <br>
                            <ins>Inline style</ins>
                            <br>
                            Inline style coding can be used if there is only a single event in a section of code, an example of this style is when a certain piece of style code such as the colour you use then placing that colour into a certain space this can be done with lines like; <q>style="colour:blue;margin-right:20px;"</q>
                            <br>
                            <ins>Internal style</ins>
                            <br>
                        The internal style of accessing CSS can be used for one single document with one single style, but is always defined within the head section of the HTML page, by using the style tag like this:<br>
                           <!--- ask shaun for help of how to make inactive tags--->
                            <ins>Exrternal</ins>
                            <br>
                            The external sytle sheet can be implemented into many different pages at once. With an external style sheet you can change the look of an entire website just by changing a single file.

                        <h3><a href="#">CSS box-model</a></h3>
                        <p style="color:black;font-family:Aclonica-Regular;">The CSS box model is often used to show how CSS should be handled in a website by creating separate sections and setting them a certain type of data to contain.
                            <br>

                            <br>
                        Content- The content box holds all the basic content that is completely necessary and wants to be shown clearly.<br>
                        Padding- A small gap held between the content and the border where unnecessary data will partially begin to fade out of the picture. 
                            <br>
                        Border- The border is the solid space that will not show any of the content data that reaches this far.<br>
                        Margin- The margin is usually set to be the edge of the page, so basically nothing should honestly even be placed in this gap.</p>

                        <p style="color:black;font-family:Aclonica-Regular;"><ins>What is a scripting language?</ins> 
                            <br>
                            One of the most basic and well known scripting languages that is used today is Javascript, developed by Netscape to give all other web developers the ability to design an interactive website. After Javascript was created it started to support all browsers as it was the only scripting language able to interact with HTML code and became an important part top our browsing experience, although we may not realise it Javascript helps us do everything from using links to other websites or simply watching a video on youtube it is all because of Javascript's ability to interact with HTML code. 
                            <br>
                            <ins>Variables?</ins>
                            <br>
                            A variable is anything where the values can be assigned to it. It can be declared as a variable using 'VAR' to a word or number. Example:
                            'script tag on'
                            <br>
                            var num=27
                            <br>
                            var name=aksh
                            <br>
                            var sum=num+name
                            <br>
                            '/script tag off'
                            <br>
                            <ins>IF and ELSE statements</ins>
                            <br>
                            Another basic part to scripting languages is allowing the code to be able to make decisions on its own.
                            <br>
                            IF statements are used in order to execute a certain piece of code but only if the specified condition is true.
                            <br>
                            ELSE statements however execute a certain piece if code if the condition is true but also executes a different piece of code for if the condition is false.
                            <br>
                            The last part I shall mention within this page for basic scripting is two kinds of loops. FOR and WHILE loops.
                            <br>
                            <ins>FOR loops</ins>
                            <br>
                            A loop is a piece of code that can be executed constantly over and over again until it fulfills a preset criterion. FOR loops will be executed while the count is less than or equal to five. Once count equals six the loop will move on to the next statement.
                            <br>
                            <ins>WHILE loops</ins>
                            <br>
                            The WHILE loops are used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. If the condition is true, the code within the selected pair of brackets is executed, then the script checks the condition againand if the condition is still true, the selected piece of code is executed again. This process continues until the condition becomes false or you use a 'break' statement to end the loop. Example:
                            <br>
                            var=0:
                            <br>
                            while(i>5)
                            {
                            st=st+i+"break"
                            }
                        </p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 ">
